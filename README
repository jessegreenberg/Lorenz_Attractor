Lorenz Attractor

This introductory program uses OpenGL to plot the lorenz attractor.

User Control:
	escape key - close the program
	Number '0' - Reset to original view
	'+' - Zoom in on Attractor
	'-' - Zoom out on attractor
	'a' - Increase rho of Lorenz parameters
	's' - Increase sigma of Lorenz parameters
	'd' - Increase beta of Lorenz Parameters
	'z' - Decrease rho of Lorenz parameters
	'x' - Decrease sigma of Lorenz parameters
	'c' - Decrease beta of Lorenz parameters
	'r' - Reset attractor to initial chaotic conditions
	space bar - begin a little animation which shows a particle 
		following the trajectory of the solution to the current
		lorenz system.
	Angles of the view controlled by the arrow keys
	
Additional Information:
	In addition to drawing the attractor, pressing the
	spacebar animates a particle following the trajectory
	of the solution. The the animation shows that the 
	velocity increases substantially for as a particle
	travels in chaotic conditions.
